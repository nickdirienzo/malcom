- [ x ] create a list that associates every MUNI stop with the URL Ross gives us for the Clipper listeners
- [ ] POST /queue {"message": str, "stop": str}
  - is there a bus at that stop at this time? Yes, enqueue and associate with vehicle. No, 404 bus not found.
- [ ] enqueue logic associate vehicle with messages
- [ ] deliver messages when they get to a stop (push into a Clipper listener) when a bus arrives (backgroudn task)
  - use the getPrediction API for all stops and if a bus is there that has a message then call the registered API
  - or look up vehicle locations and do lat+long math to determine if it's at a stop and deliver message if so
